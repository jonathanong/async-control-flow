# Parallel

Very often, you'd want to read multiple files at once.
Your task:

- Read multiple files in parallel as strings.
- Concatenate the strings in order.
- Return the concatenated string.
- It should not use the `async` module (remove the `require()`!).
- It should return a promise.
- Support support a callback.
